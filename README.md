## User-Stories

After working closely with salons for some time developing websites and offering online booking solutions,  the needs of a salon and their customers became very clear. Beauty4U is designed to meet said needs. First, let’s define broadly what those needs are from both the salon owner’s perspective and the salon customer.

### Salon Owner
- Have a visually appealing website that can be used to attract new customers online through various marketing channels 
- Sell hair and beauty products online to their customers 
- Offer online booking to their customers while keeping the control 
- Stay in touch with current customers to keep them informed about offers, new services etc 
- Keep track of website performance 

### Salon Customer
- Shop online for hair and beauty products in a modern ecommerce environment 
- Make bookings online 
- Get in touch with the salon 

These are the broad goals from both perspectives. The development of Beauty4U was entirely driven by these clearly defined goals. Each of these goals will be described in more detail below along with how each goal was achieved 

### A Visually Appealing and Easy to Use Website 
The salon industry, as one can imagine,  is a very visual one. While also being visual, it is not notoriously known for being a technical one. Customers vary widely in age. Therefore, in order to attract customers and impress potential clients, a salon must have a visually appealing website that is simple and easy to use. Beauty4U was designed with this in mind. Colour Schemes are bright and contrasting for ease of use. Navigation menus are short and simple with descriptive ‘call to actions’. Shop menus are broken down into intuitive sections such as ‘Brands’ or ‘Categories’. User feedback is provided throughout to give both the salon owner and the customer the confidence and safety to use all features comfortably. 

### (The Customer) Shop online for hair and beauty products in a modern ecommerce environment

Customers are used to seamless shopping experiences and have a set expectation when shopping online. These expectations must be met in order for the salon to have a successful ecommerce site. Beauty4U is built with these in mind. Products are laid out cleanly and prices easily visible. The user can easily search for products or navigate menus to find what they are looking for. Users can read and add reviews for each product. Users can create accounts and keep a record of their orders. They can add/remove items to/from a user friendly shopping cart. They can checkout in a secure environment with all checkout information easily available to them (shipping costs, shipping methods). 

### (The Salon Owner) Sell hair and beauty products online to their customers

In order to run a successful ecommerce website, the salon owner requires a number of things. Firstly, the shop must be easily managed.  Salon owners can find clunky CMS’s like Woocommerce intimidating and difficult to use. Beauty4U provides the salon with an easy to use management dashboard where they can perform key shop management duties. They can add/remove products, make updates to existing products, add/remove product categories & brands, upload/change product images, put products on sale, and manage product stock. 

Offering customers incentives to buy online is key to running a successful ecommerce website. Within the beauty4U management dashboard, shop owners can easily create  coupon discount codes that they can offer to customers. They can send out marketing emails to all their customers informing them of discount offers for the online shop.

Salon owners can also set a free shipping offer from within their dashboard and choose whether or not to activate it. They can set the threshold for free shipping.

Salons can also choose whether or not to offer a ‘Click & Collect’ service with the simple toggle of a button.

### (The Salon Owner) Keep track of website performance 

It’s important for the salon owner to know how well their website and ecommerce shop are performing so they can make adjustments accordingly. The Beauty4U management dashboard offers the owner insights into unique website visitors and advises them when website traffic has reduced. They can view their shop earnings and number of products they have sold. 

### (The Customer) Make bookings online 

Online booking has become very popular in recent times. When a customer visits a salon website, they expect to be able to book services online. Beauty4U offers the customer the ability to select services for booking, select dates,times, and staff members and request a booking. They will then receive an email from the salon once their booking has been confirmed. 

### (The Salon Owner) Offer online booking 

Online booking is a must for any salon. Customers expect to be able to make bookings online. However, most salons still want to keep control over their books! Customers often don’t know how long a service might take, what staff member is best fit etc.. Beauty4U offers the salon an online booking system that keeps the control with the salon. Customers request a booking online and the salon receives an email with the booking details. They can check the details and see if the request is possible.  They can enter their management dashboard and from there and confirm the booking with one click. Once a booking is confirmed, the customer will receive an email to say their booking has been confirmed. If the booking is not suitable, the salon owner can contact the customer using the details provided in their management dashboard.   

Salon owners can also input their opening hours in the dashboard which will map to their booking system. If they are closed on Mondays, they can mark Monday closed and customers will not be able to request bookings for that day. Opening hours are also displayed in the footer of the website. 


### (The Salon Owner ) Stay in touch with current customers to keep them informed about offers, new services etc 

Salon Owners can send marketing emails to all their registered customers directly from their management dashboard; making it easy to keep customers informed about the latest news and offers 

### (The Customer ) Get in touch with the salon

Beauty4U offers an easy to use contact us form so that customers can easily get in touch with the salon
